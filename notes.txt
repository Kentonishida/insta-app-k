What is middleware?
Answer: The middleware provides a mechanism for inspecting the HTTP request entering our application.
If the user is not authenticated, then they cannot login to application. They can only go to login page

Think of the "MIDDLEWARE" as an additional layer of security that examines the request going through the application

The objective is we are going our own middleware. We will call "AdminMiddleware"

The "AdminMiddleware" will allow the access to the admin dashboard. Our basis the role_id from the database
Note: If the role_id of a user is equal 1, then they have access to the admin dashboard.


What is GATE? --> is going to check whether the person/user is authorized to perform action/to click button, etc...
